We will be adding more addition actions to this script

* nslookup.py - This script was for the full intention of Network Admin,Engineers for troubleshooting purposes. Plug N Play = Copy and paste all of the hosts "Line per line". Once done hit enter to add an extra empty line and hit CTRL D to quit the interactive prompt and then perform the action you would like to take.

* spelling.py - This is for MAC users ONLY!!! - I have created this script to help my son in school. As he gets about 30 words for the week to learn and test out on Friday. The script will say the word and the user/son is to type the correct word if wrong after 5 trys then it will display the word.    FYI - MAC have the ability to read out what you type!!

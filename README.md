* nslookup.py - This script was for the full intention of Network Admin,Engineers for troubleshooting purposes. Plug N Play = Copy and paste all of the hosts "Line per line". Once done hit enter to add an extra empty line and hit CTRL D to quit the interactive prompt and then perform the action you would like to take.

* spelling.py - This is for MAC users ONLY!!! - I have created this script to help my son in school. As he gets about 30 words for the week to learn and test out on Friday. The script will say the word and the user/son is to type the correct word if wrong after 5 trys then it will display the word.    FYI - MAC have the ability to read out what you type!!


* MATH - There are four scripts; Addition, subraction, division, multiplication.  Enter the number of operations you want your kid to do for their daily  operations. 
**** FYI - you can change the DIFFICULTY by editing lines 27 and 28 - this increments the number of digits in the operations. You may contact me I would be more than happy to assist!

* sshbruteforce.py - SSH brute force - Need two files; users.txt & passwords.txt. Also be sure to update target IP
